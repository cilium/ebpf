# About {{ proj }}

The project was initially created in 2017 as [`newtools/ebpf`](https://github.com/newtools/ebpf) by [Nathan
Sweet](https://github.com/nathanjsweet). It quickly gained traction within the Go community for projects that couldn't
or wouldn't build upon the CGo-based BCC bindings at the time (`gobpf`).

Since then, it's been widely adopted by hundreds of open-source projects, by large industry players, and by startups
building their businesses on top of eBPF alike. Today, it continues to evolve thanks to its thriving community and close
collaboration with the upstream Linux project.
