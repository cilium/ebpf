# About {{ proj }}

The project was initially created in 2017 as
[`newtools/ebpf`](https://github.com/newtools/ebpf). It quickly gained traction
within the Go community, especially for projects that couldn't or wouldn't build
upon the CGo-based BCC bindings at the time (`gobpf`).

Since then, it's been widely adopted by hundreds of open-source projects, large
industry players, as well as startups building their businesses on top of eBPF.
It continues to evolve thanks to its thriving community and close collaboration
with the upstream Linux project.
